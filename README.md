# About The Project

I find reumes boring and too short. I wanted a way to better show off my projects and expierences. I felt there was no better way then putting my skills to use and creating my own portflio website.
<a href='https://sjdefran.com' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Check it out!</a>
## Frontend
* ReactJS
* MaterialUI (mui)
* npm
#### Deployed using Github Pages

This is my first project using react and very little expierence with JavaScript as well. I learned a lot about both but still have a lot more to learn. One thing I want to improve on is getting better with creating very reusable components. In places I have some uneeded repition of code that could be cleaned up. 

MaterialUI is an incredible tool that makes creating a pretty website a lot easier! I'm glad I stumbled across the framework as it was easy to use and quickly creates
super clean content. 

Look at the branch <a href='https://github.com/sjdefran1/mysite/tree/gh-pages'>gh-pages</a> to see the static site, codebase located in main <a href='https://github.com/sjdefran1/mysite/tree/main/frontend'>frontend/</a>

## Backend
* Python
* FastAPI
* Deta db
#### Deployed using Deta
The backend recieves messages from the "Contact Me" section of the site. I used smtblib to text my phone w/ the recieved message from a created gmail account. The backend also stores the messages within a NoSQL database provided by Deta.

Deta is a free hosting service that sponsors FastAPI. They allow you to create what they call a "micro" where you can host your Fastapi server. 

### ChatGPT
ChatGPT is amazing. It helped me through leraning react & assisted in places on the backend as well. ChatGPT is great for fixing bugs and helping you understand different code examples found on the internet. If you are a developer and haven't played with GPT yet, I highly reccomend you give it a try.
